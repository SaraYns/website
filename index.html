        <h2>Tourism</h2>
        <p>Tourism in Spain is the third major contributor to national economic life after the industrial and the
         <br>business/banking sectors,<span>contributing about 10–11% of Spain's GDP. </span> Ever since the 1960s and 1970s, the 
         <br> country has been a popular destination for summer holidays. Accordingly, Spain's foreign tourist industry
         <br> has grown into the second-biggest in the world. In 2019, Spain was the second most visited country in the 
         <br> world, recording 83.7 million tourists which marked the seventh consecutive year of record-beating numbers.
         <br> Spain ranks first.
        </p>
        <p>So, what makes Spain the ideal country to visit?</p>

            <p>The kingdom of Spain is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern
             <br> Europe, with archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, and several small territories
             <br> on and near the North African coast. Its Mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean
             <br> Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra,
             <br> and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Along with France
             <br> and Morocco, it is one of only three countries to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines. Spain
             <br> includes a number of islands including Mallorca, Tenerife, Ibiza and Gran Canaria.</p>

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>There are three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and orographic conditions:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>The Mediterranean climate:</dt>
                <dd>characterized by warm and dry summers. It is dominant in the peninsula, with two varieties: Csa and Csb according
                  <br>to the Köppen climate classification. The Csb Zone, with a more extreme climate, hotter in summer and colder
                  <br>in winter, extends to additional areas such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. Valladolid,
                  <br>Burgos, León).</dd>
                 <dt>The semi-arid climate:</dt>
                 <dd>located in the southeastern quarter of the country, especially in the region of Murcia and in the Ebro valley.
                    <br>In contrast with the Mediterranean climate, the dry season extends beyond the summer.</dd>
                 <dt>The oceanic climate:</dt>
                 <dd>located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the region of Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias
                    <br>and partly Galicia. In contrary to the Mediterranean climate, winter and summer temperatures are influenced 
                    <br>by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.
