    <img src="cathedral.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Spain has an extraordinary artistic heritage. The Golden Age dominant figures were the Toledo-based
     <br>artists El Greco and Diego Velázquez. In the 18th century Francisco de Goya emerged. Later, in the
     <br>early 20th century a remarkable group of Spanish artists became the ambassadors of the artistic culture
     <br> in Spain such as Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí.</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>Spain's architecture ranges from prehistoric monuments in Minorca in the Balearic Islands, to the Roman

    <h2>Music of Spain</h2>
    <h3>Flamenco</h3>
    <img src="dancers.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with flamenco, a West Andalusian musical genre,
     <br>which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of folk
     <br>music abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia and Asturias. Pop, rock,
     <br>hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.</p>
     <h3>Classical Music</h3>
     <p>In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as Isaac Albéniz, Manuel de Falla and Enrique 
      <br>Granados and singers and performers such as Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, Montserrat Caballé, Alicia de Larrocha, Alfredo Kraus, 
      <br>Pablo Casals, Ricardo Viñes, José Iturbi, Pablo de Sarasate, Jordi Savall and Teresa Berganza. In Spain there are over forty professional
      <br>orchestras, including the Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona, Orquesta Nacional de España and the Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid. Major 
      <br>opera houses include the Teatro Real, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Teatro Arriaga and the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía.
     </p>
     <h3>Musical Instruments</h3>
     <p>The most popular traditional musical instrument, the guitar, originated in Spain.</p>

    <h2>Festivals</h2>
    <img src="matador.jpg" alt="">
    <p>There are many festivals and festivities in Spain. Some of them are known worldwide, and every year millions
     <br>of people from all over the world go to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous
     <br>is San Fermín, in Pamplona. While its most famous event is the encierro, or the running of the bulls, which
     <br>happens at 8:00 am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric
     <br>events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway, which brought it to
     <br>the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it has become one of the most internationally
     <br>renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year. Thousands of music fans also 
     <br>travel to Spain each year for internationally recognized summer music festivals Sónar which often features
     <br>the top up and coming pop and techno acts, and Benicàssim which tends to feature alternative rock and dance
     <br>acts. Both festivals mark Spain as an international music presence and reflect the tastes of young people 
     <br>in the country.</p>

    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
     <p>Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and 
     <br>climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and
     <br>reflects the country's deep Mediterranean roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences
     <br>has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:</p>
